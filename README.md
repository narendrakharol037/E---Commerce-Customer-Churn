### KPIs

1. Churn Rate: Churn Rate is a critical metric that measures the percentage of customers who stop using a company's products or services during a specific time period.

churn rate = (Total Number of Customers at the Start of the Period / Number of Customers Churned during a Period)*100
​
 

2. Customer Lifetime Value: CLV is a key metric that estimates the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer account throughout the entire relationship with that customer.

  CLV = Average Purchase Value * Average Purchase Frequency * Customer Lifespan


3. Return Rate: Number of products returned by the customer.

   Return rate = total no. of products return / total quantity


4. Average Purchase Frequency: The average number of times a customer makes a purchase over a specific period.
