### KPIs

1. Churn Rate: Churn Rate is a critical metric that measures the percentage of customers who stop using a company's products or services during a specific time period.

churn rate = (TotalÂ NumberÂ ofÂ CustomersÂ atÂ theÂ StartÂ ofÂ theÂ Period / NumberÂ ofÂ CustomersÂ ChurnedÂ duringÂ aÂ Period)*100
â€‹
 

2. Customer Lifetime Value: CLV is a key metric that estimates the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer account throughout the entire relationship with that customer.

  CLV = AverageÂ PurchaseÂ Value * AverageÂ PurchaseÂ Frequency * CustomerÂ Lifespan


3. Return Rate: Number of products returned by the customer.

   Return rate = total no. of products return / total quantity


4. Average Purchase Frequency: The average number of times a customer makes a purchase over a specific period.

   APF = TotalÂ NumberÂ ofÂ UniqueÂ Customers / TotalÂ NumberÂ ofÂ Purchases
